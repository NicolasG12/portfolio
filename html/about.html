      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am Nicolas Guevara, a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz Game Design department. I
         have worked on both 2D and 3D games in Unity and C#, as well as Unreal Engine 5 and C++. My focus has been on gameplay programming, NPC
         programming and UI programming.
         Outside of Unity I have worked with 3D rendering and graphics in C++ and OpenGL, as well as some creative coding using the
         JavaScript library p5js.
